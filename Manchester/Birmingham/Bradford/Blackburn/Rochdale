I'm in Manchester, have been with them for a year and couldn't be happier. I hated virgin media with a passion. Currently paying £35 a month for 1gbps symmetrical (£5 of that is for a static IP).

They installed within two days of placing the order. Installation took about two hours. They run a line from a pole to an outside wall, then drill through the wall. They guy couldn't use the original pole as a tree was in the way, so made a call and used the next pole along the street.

No discernable downtime in the year I have had them. I thought I may have to replace the router they supplied, but bar a spot in the cellar the router covers the house well enough for what we need it for (router is on first floor).
Speeds are good, can hit over 600ml in same room over wifi, 300mbps living room downstairs.

Haven't tried to optimise this (turning off the apple IP tracking thing or using ethernet cable, probably should). Xbox is wifi connected downstairs and ping is low teens whenever I check.

Dozens of things connected (computers, tv's, smart speakers, tablets, phones etc). If I do an ethernet speed test I'll post back. Never had a single discernable problem with dropouts.

Customer service has been excellent. Had a query I submitted over chat, they called my mobile within 20 mins to answer! (there have been a couple of posts saying the customer service isn't as good any more, but can only go by my experience). Installation guy was great, spent the extra time to sort out the feed from a second pole when the first was obscured by a tree.

I was a bit wary of going with a lesser known company as I'm dependent on internet for work. We actually ran brsk alongside virgin for 2 months to make sure.

Any questions feel free to ask. I'll try to do a proper speed test at some point and update.

My referral code for a £75 amazon voucher is https://brsk.uk/2HHK
They send an email with it to both parties 30 days after installation.
